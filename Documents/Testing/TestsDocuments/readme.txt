Documents which describe the individual tests to be performed will be placed in TestDocuments.

 Although you only need to write specifications for the new functions you will create, you will need to write test descriptions for both the existing functions provided for you as well as the new functions you create. 

You should either create subdirectories for black box tests, white box tests, integration tests and acceptance tests or name the test documents so that the type of test they describe is indicated in the file name
