Weekly scrum reports should be stored in the ScrumReports directory at the end of every class. 
You should change the name of each scrum report to have the milestone number in the name to make it easy to identify.

• The group contract should be completed and stored in the GroupContract directory.

• Function specifications refer to the new functions you will be writing to complete the project. 
	These function specifications are textual documents that use the provided template and should be stored in the FunctionSpecs directory.
	
• All documents about testing should be stored in the Testing directory. The main Test Plan and the traceability matrix should go in the TestPlan directory.

• Documents which describe the individual tests to be performed will be placed in TestDocuments. 
	Although you only need to write specifications for the new functions you will create, you will need to write test descriptions for both the existing functions provided for you as well as the new functions you create. 
	You should either create subdirectories for black box tests, white box tests, integration tests and acceptance tests or name the test documents so that the type of test they describe is indicated in the file name.
